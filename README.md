# TypeScript Express Mongoose Boilerplate

## Scripts

Start the server in development mode with auto refresh on change

    npm start
    
Run the unit tests with optional watch script

    npm test
    npm test:watch

Seed data for testing. This will create 10 users with the default password "Testing123!"

    npm run seed

## Environment Settings

There is a .env file in the root folder that contains all definitions.
Using the dotenv NPM package, it will load it into the process.env object.
<b>It is recommended that you add the .env to your gitignore when cloning this project as it will contain sensitive data.</b>
